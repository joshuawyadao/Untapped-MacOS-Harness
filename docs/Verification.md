# Verification and reward milestone

This record distinguishes static inspection, startup, game detection, reader attachment, state reading, and overlay display. Each requires separate evidence. The pinned user-supplied companion was `3.12.3-latest` with `app.asar` SHA-256 `ca3a2e6a6f728b2d635abfc70a5434d4107438b8d801a650357989e8442d798c`.

| Milestone | October 30, 2026 result | Evidence or next check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Static inspection | Verified | Exact archive hash, guarded STS2 gates, bundled overlay/reader, and both Electron fuse wires `10110001` reproduced. |
| Source and preparation | Verified | Source signature valid outside the Codex sandbox; a copy-only patched session was prepared. Signature checks inside the Codex sandbox were misleading, so that environment is not used to judge vendor validity. |
| Offline policy | Smoke-tested | Real-home read, outside write, and remote IP socket denied; session write and loopback allowed. |
| Companion startup | **Not observed** | One 15-second offline launch hit its time limit with no bootstrap event, vendor log, or stdout. Cause unknown. The Mac UI could not be inspected because it was locked; that does not establish the cause. |
| Native game window detection | Untested | Requires a `window-detected` event from the copied companion. |
| Reader attachment | Untested | Requires `attach-attempt`, then `reader-connected` after vendor `connect()` reports success. The `status` label is `CONNECT_ACKNOWLEDGED`: native connection and runtime wrapper setup were acknowledged, but later game-context traversal remains unproved. Window detection alone is insufficient. |
| Reward state | Untested | Requires a real `reward` event with card IDs, upgrades, and normalized positions matching the visible game screen. |
| Overlay and recommendations | Untested | Need visual overlay evidence and separate advice validation; neither follows from a reward event. |

The preparation made no signing or entitlement change. No game was launched, no save was read, no terms were accepted, and no account or run was uploaded. Twenty synthetic tests passed, including Node VM execution of the original bootstrap against stubs; vendor code and native modules were not executed in that suite. The CI test job checks portable harness behavior and repository hygiene, not macOS game compatibility.

## Commands and private evidence

Use the commands in the [README](../README.md). `inspect` prints pinned-source observations. `prepare` creates `manifest.json` inside a fresh private session. `launch` is single use per session; it returns a nonzero status if `ready` is not observed. `ELECTRON_READY` means Electron reached its readiness callback; it does not prove Untapped's UI or services finished initializing. `status` reads only that session's private events and log. A manifest records static preparation, not proof of startup. Do not commit or publish session logs, events, screenshots, or a modified companion copy without reviewing personal data and third-party rights.

Before a real reward experiment, establish a game-profile, save, and Steam Cloud strategy. Do not copy or symlink actual saves by default. No signing, debugger entitlement, or system protection change should follow from this record without a concrete failure and a specific reviewed proposal.

## Reward comparison contract

A later real screen can be transcribed into a private JSON file, with visible cards from left to right and normalized coordinates (`0`–`1` relative to the game screen):

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {"id": "EXAMPLE_CARD_A", "upgradeLevel": 0, "cx": 0.25, "cy": 0.5, "width": 0.12, "height": 0.2},
    {"id": "EXAMPLE_CARD_B", "upgradeLevel": 1, "cx": 0.75, "cy": 0.5, "width": 0.12, "height": 0.2}
  ]
}
```

These IDs are synthetic and do not assert actual game identifiers. Run `python3 -m harness.cli compare-reward /private/tmp/untapped-sts2-session /private/tmp/expected-reward.json --reward-index 0`, choosing the zero-based reward event to inspect. The tool sorts cards by `cx`, then `cy`, requires exact count/ID/upgrade level, and allows at most `0.03` absolute difference in each normalized center/size coordinate. It also requires preceding bootstrap, ready, window, attach-attempt, and reader-connected events. A comparison can validate the one-screen reader milestone; overlay positioning, tier lists, statistics, and adaptive recommendations need their own checks.
